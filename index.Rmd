I am currently a PhD student in economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago](https://www.chicagofed.org/people/f/fogarty-michael/). I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a bachelors degree in Economics and Political Science in 2019.
