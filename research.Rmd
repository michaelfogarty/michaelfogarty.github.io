My research interests include urban economics, public finance, fiscal federalism, political economy and applied microeconomics more broadly.

I was previously a reserach assistant on the regional team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 

I have worked with [Professor Therese McGuire](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/mcguire_therese.aspx) on several projects related to fiscal federalism in the United State, Canada, Germany, and Spain. Additionally, I have prepared homeworks and lectures for her [state and local public economics course](https://www4.kellogg.northwestern.edu/syllabus/syllabus_files/KPPI-480-0-31_Fall2018.pdf) for Kellogg MBA students.

My undergraduate [honors thesis](files/Honors_Thesis.pdf) examined the possibility of correcting sample selection bias with detailed controls, using a large dataset of wholesale used car auctions. My thesis won the Adam Smith Prize for Excellence in Economics.
